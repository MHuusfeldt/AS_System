ðŸ”§ Form-Based Solution for Dropdown Refresh Issues
==================================================

## âœ… Problem Solved:
**Issue**: Dropdown and input changes were causing page refreshes, interrupting the user experience
**Root Cause**: Streamlit widgets trigger reruns when their values change, causing form state to reset

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Implemented:

### **Form-Based Input Handling**
- Wrapped all input controls (selectbox, slider, number_input, text_area) in a `st.form()`
- Added a single "Start Screening" submit button that processes all inputs at once
- Form prevents individual widget changes from triggering page reruns

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Individual Keys**: Eliminated specific widget keys that were causing conflicts
2. **Form Structure**: 
   ```python
   with st.form("screener_form"):
       # All input widgets here
       market_selection = st.selectbox(...)
       min_score = st.slider(...)
       max_stocks = st.number_input(...)
       custom_symbols = st.text_area(...)
       
       # Single submit button
       submitted = st.form_submit_button("ðŸš€ Start Screening")
   ```

3. **Session State Updates**: Only update session state when form is actually submitted
4. **Configuration Display**: Show current settings when form is not being processed

### **Benefits:**
- âœ… **No More Page Refreshes**: Users can change dropdown selections without interruption
- âœ… **Better UX**: All settings are configured before starting the screening process  
- âœ… **Stable Interface**: Form maintains state until explicitly submitted
- âœ… **Clear Feedback**: Users see current configuration before running screening

### **How It Works Now:**
1. User opens Market Screener tab
2. User adjusts all settings (market, score threshold, max results, custom symbols)
3. Settings changes don't trigger page refreshes
4. User clicks "Start Screening" when ready
5. Form submits all values at once and begins screening process
6. Results display without interface interruption

### **Technical Implementation:**
- `st.form()` encapsulates all input widgets
- `st.form_submit_button()` processes all inputs simultaneously  
- Session state preservation maintains user preferences
- Conditional logic shows configuration vs. results based on form state

## ðŸ§ª Expected Behavior:
- **Before**: Dropdown changes â†’ page refresh â†’ lost state â†’ frustrating UX
- **After**: Dropdown changes â†’ no refresh â†’ stable interface â†’ smooth UX
- **Screening**: Single button click â†’ processing â†’ results without interruption

This form-based approach completely eliminates the dropdown refresh issue while maintaining all functionality.
